LLVM IR Analysis

Generated LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) using Clang to analyze compiler optimization pipeline.

Observations:
- IR shows low-level instruction transformation before machine code generation.
- Helps visualize optimization passes such as instruction simplification and loop transformations.
- Demonstrates internal compiler behavior independent of hardware architecture.
